 DS230 Final Project – Fall 2025
 Instacart Reorder & Next Order Prediction

This project is implemented as a **step-by-step walkthrough pipeline**, following the official course project requirements.

The goal is to predict:
- Task A (Classification):** whether a (user, product) pair will be reordered in the user’s next order.
- Task B (Regression):** predict **days_to_next_order** for a user.

feature engineering, modeling, explainability, and robustness) to ensure clarity
and reproducibility.

 Execution Order

Notebooks should be run in the following order:

1. EDA: missing values analysis, distributions, correlations, and temporal patterns.
2. Preprocessing: data joins, cleaning, imputation, outlier handling, scaling, and leakage prevention.
3. Feature Engineering: user-level, product-level, user–product interaction, temporal, and non-linear features.
4. Classification: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost with full evaluation metrics.
5. Regression: linear and tree-based models with residual analysis.
6. Explainability: SHAP, partial dependence plots, and feature importance analysis.
7. Robustness: noise injection, outlier sensitivity, and reduced data experiments.

 Validation & Tuning

- Time-aware cross-validation is used to respect the temporal structure of the data.
- GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV are applied for hyperparameter tuning.
- One nested cross-validation experiment is included for final model selection.

 Conclusion:
This project presents a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for
predicting product reorders and time to next order using Instacart data.
Through extensive preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation,
and robustness testing, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of
tree-based and gradient boosting models. The project emphasizes
reproducibility, interpretability, and adherence to the DS230 course
requirements.
